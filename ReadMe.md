# Project Name

Faced with the drop in educational levels observed following the closure of schools, the “Ministério da Educação” (Portuguese Ministry of Education) is contacting you, with the idea of using data and AI to try to remedy the situation.

The Ministry would like the educational advisors of each establishment to have a tool allowing them to prioritize the students to be supported. To do this, they are imagining a dashboard that would make it possible to prioritize the students to be supported based on the complexity and value of such support.
